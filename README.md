# dotfiles

Add some tweaks into current Unix/Ubuntu user's home directory.
Inspired by <https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles> for MacOS.
For Windows I prefer my <https://github.com/StefanScherer/dotfiles-windows>.

# Installation
    git clone https://github.com/StefanScherer/dotfiles && cd dotfiles && ./sync.sh

To update later on, just run the sync again.
